## Coding Dojo Practice 05.17.2022

### Objectives

* Practice using ```onmouseover``` and ```onmouseout```
* Practice working from an existing code base

For this assignment we'll be working with some existing code (download [here](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/1624039965__video-preview.zip)) to add a video in. We'll want to find a free video that we want to work with from https://www.pexels.com/videos/.  Next we'll want to add the video into a video tag in the HTML. To make the website more interactive add hover events to play and pause the video when hovering.
